"Fabric is a Python (2.5 or higher) library and command-line tool for "
"streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems "

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial.rst:22
msgid ""
"A tool that lets you execute **arbitrary Python functions** via the "
"**command line**;"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial.rst:24
msgid ""
"A library of subroutines (built on top of a lower-level library) to make "
"executing shell commands over SSH **easy** and **Pythonic**."
msgstr ""

"Naturally, most users combine these two things, using Fabric to write and "

#: ../../tutorial.rst:49

"That's all there is to it. This functionality allows Fabric to be used as a "
"(very) basic build tool even without importing any of its API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorial.rst:54

"The ``fab`` tool simply imports your fabfile and executes the function or "

"It's often useful to pass runtime parameters into your tasks, just as you "
"might during regular Python programming. Fabric has basic support for this "
"using a shell-compatible notation: ``<task "
"name>:<arg>,<kwarg>=<value>,...``. It's contrived, but let's extend the "
"above example to say hello to you personally::"

"Let's build a hypothetical Web application fabfile. This example scenario is"
" as follows: The Web application is managed via Git on a remote host "
"``vcshost``. On ``localhost``, we have a local clone of said Web "
"application. When we push changes back to ``vcshost``, we want to be able to"
" immediately install these changes on a remote host ``my_server`` in an "

"As with our calls to `~fabric.operations.local` above, "
"`~fabric.operations.run` also lets us construct clean Python-level logic "

"``git clone`` call: since we're using Git's SSH method of accessing the "
"repository on our Git server, this means our remote `~fabric.operations.run`"
" call will need to authenticate itself."

"Specifying connection info at runtime gets old real fast, so Fabric provides"
