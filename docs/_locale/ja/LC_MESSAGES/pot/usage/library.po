"Fabric's primary use case is via fabfiles and the :doc:`fab </usage/fab>` "
"tool, and this is reflected in much of the documentation. However, Fabric's "
"internals are written in such a manner as to be easily used without ``fab`` "
"or fabfiles at all -- this document will show you how."

#: ../../usage/library.rst:10

"There's really only a couple of considerations one must keep in mind, when "
"compared to writing a fabfile and using ``fab`` to run it: how connections "
"are really made, and how disconnections occur."

"We've documented how Fabric really connects to its hosts before, but it's "
"currently somewhat buried in the middle of the overall :doc:`execution docs "
"</usage/execution>`. Specifically, you'll want to skip over to the "
":ref:`connections` section and read it real quick. (You should really give "
"that entire document a once-over, but it's not absolutely required.)"

#: ../../usage/library.rst:23

"As that section mentions, the key is simply that `~fabric.operations.run`, "
"`~fabric.operations.sudo` and the other operations only look in one place "
"when connecting: :ref:`env.host_string <host_string>`. All of the other "
"mechanisms for setting hosts are interpreted by the ``fab`` tool when it "
"runs, and don't matter when running as a library."

"That said, most use cases where you want to marry a given task ``X`` and a "
"given list of hosts ``Y`` can, as of Fabric 1.3, be handled with the "
"`~fabric.tasks.execute` function via ``execute(X, hosts=Y)``. Please see "
"`~fabric.tasks.execute`'s documentation for details -- manual host string "
"manipulation should be rarely necessary."

"The other main thing that ``fab`` does for you is to disconnect from all "
"hosts at the end of a session; otherwise, Python will sit around forever "
"waiting for those network resources to be released."

"Fabric 0.9.4 and newer have a function you can use to do this easily: "
"`~fabric.network.disconnect_all`. Simply make sure your code calls this when"
" it terminates (typically in the ``finally`` clause of an outer ``try: "
"finally`` statement -- lest errors in your code prevent disconnections from "
"happening!) and things ought to work pretty well."

"This document is an early draft, and may not cover absolutely every "
"difference between ``fab`` use and library use. However, the above should "
"highlight the largest stumbling blocks. When in doubt, note that in the "
"Fabric source code, ``fabric/main.py`` contains the bulk of the extra work "
"done by ``fab``, and may serve as a useful reference."
