"By default, Fabric executes all specified tasks **serially** (see :ref"

" for running tasks on multiple hosts in **parallel**, via per-task "
"decorators and/or global command-line switches."

"Because Fabric 1.x is not fully threadsafe (and because in general use, task"
" functions do not typically interact with one another) this functionality is"
" implemented via the Python `multiprocessing "
"<http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html>`_ module. It creates "
"one new process for each host and task combination, optionally using a "
"(configurable) sliding window to prevent too many processes from running at "
"the same time."

"For example, imagine a scenario where you want to update Web application "
"code on a number of Web servers, and then reload the servers once the code "
"has been distributed everywhere (to allow for easier rollback if code "
"updates fail.) One could implement this with the following fabfile::"

"Fabric's default mode of printing to the terminal is byte-by-byte, in order "

"To help offset this problem, Fabric's option for linewise output is "

"invocations, it's typically a fair trade."
