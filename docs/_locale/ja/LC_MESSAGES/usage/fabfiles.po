"Fabric is capable of loading Python modules (e.g. ``fabfile.py``) or "
"packages (e.g. a ``fabfile/`` directory containing an ``__init__.py``). By "
"default, it looks for something named (to Python's import machinery) "
"``fabfile`` - so either ``fabfile/`` or ``fabfile.py``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/fabfiles.rst:18
msgid ""
"The fabfile discovery algorithm searches in the invoking user's current "
"working directory or any parent directories. Thus, it is oriented around "
"\"project\" use, where one keeps e.g. a ``fabfile.py`` at the root of a "
"source code tree. Such a fabfile will then be discovered no matter where in "
"the tree the user invokes ``fab``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../usage/fabfiles.rst:24
msgid ""
"The specific name to be searched for may be overridden on the command-line "
"with the :option:`-f` option, or by adding a :ref:`fabricrc <fabricrc>` line"
" which sets the value of ``fabfile``. For example, if you wanted to name "
"your fabfile ``fab_tasks.py``, you could create such a file and then call "
"``fab -f fab_tasks.py <task name>``, or add ``fabfile = fab_tasks.py`` to "
"``~/.fabricrc``."

msgid ""
"If the given fabfile name contains path elements other than a filename (e.g."
" ``../fabfile.py`` or ``/dir1/dir2/custom_fabfile``) it will be treated as a"
" file path and directly checked for existence without any sort of searching."
" When in this mode, tilde-expansion will be applied, so one may refer to "
"e.g. ``~/personal_fabfile.py``."

"Fabric does a normal ``import`` (actually an ``__import__``) of your fabfile"
" in order to access its contents -- it does not do any ``eval``-ing or "
"similar. In order for this to work, Fabric temporarily adds the found "
"fabfile's containing folder to the Python load path (and removes it "
"immediately afterwards.)"

"Because Fabric is just Python, you *can* import its components any way you "
"want. However, for the purposes of encapsulation and convenience (and to "
"make life easier for Fabric's packaging script) Fabric's public API is "
"maintained in the ``fabric.api`` module."

"All of Fabric's :doc:`../api/core/operations`, "
":doc:`../api/core/context_managers`, :doc:`../api/core/decorators` and "
":doc:`../api/core/utils` are included in this module as a single, flat "
"namespace. This enables a very simple and consistent interface to Fabric "
"within your fabfiles::"

"This is not technically best practices (for `a number of reasons`_) and if "
"you're only using a couple of Fab API calls, it *is* probably a good idea to"
" explicitly ``from fabric.api import env, run`` or similar. However, in most"
" nontrivial fabfiles, you'll be using all or most of the API, and the star "
"import::"
